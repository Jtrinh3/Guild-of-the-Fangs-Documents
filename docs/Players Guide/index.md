# Player's Guide

## Metagaming Statement
The world we journey in is not defined by any texts or foretold tales. The books that lay before us (PHB, Xanathar’s, Monster Manual, etc) can be helpful in understanding this place, but should not be relied on for fact regarding history, trivia, metrics or the details of one’s foe.

You need not worry about metagaming by using these books at the table. All that is found within represents information that one would be likely to find in a nearby library or from a local historian, and if you go to these lengths in our game your character is entitled to all the knowledge they hold. This includes the stat blocks that are listed for the species covered, which represent setting appropriate estimates and anecdotes detailing the appropriate metrics based on personal accounts and encounters.

It is worth noting that as historical estimates and anecdotes often are, the player’s handbook and other such guides are often inaccurate and certainly incomplete. What if the great Basalisk really only has four legs but the last time anyone fought one the lone survivor was a knight who suffered horrible brain damage blurring his memory of the event? Would that be a likely detail to be covered by the castle’s historian? Maybe the last time an ancient green dragon was slain was in the Bronze Age, a time of swords that couldn’t hold an edge the way modern steel can. Perhaps the party a king once commissioned to seek out and slay a beholder for study failed to track one altogether, but made up a story to save their necks. It’s possible that the cat-like form of a displacer beast was just the form that particular creature chose that day, and that was the last time one ever fought anyone who cared to write it down. While the guides we use are simple and effective for our use, they would not be that way in the context our characters would find them. Our guides instead allude to our characters’ clumsy interpretations of the histories they would really find. - [/u/REDDIT_BULL_WORM](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/e59efx/this_is_a_talk_i_like_to_give_at_session_zero_it/)


## Rules
Please respect your fellow members and follow the guideline we set below. Failure to do so will result in infractions.
* Don't be a wangrod. Treat others fairly. We're all here to have fun, not argue.
* Use common sense. Don't be *that* guy.
* If anything makes you uncomfortable during a session, do call for a time out at the table and address it.
* By default, Player vs Player (PvP) is not allowed. No non-consensual PvP. If the situation requires PvP, try to make it non-lethal. This includes touching other people’s possessions.
* If you have feedback for the DM during a session, consider if it is of immediate importance or if it can wait till end of the session. __The Dungeon Master abjudicates the rules.__
* **#party-rolls** is not a channel for chatting; It is for the Dungeon Masters to keep track of mission rolls. Consider **#adventure-party** for mission related chatter and **#gen-chat** for most of everything else.
* As with D&D and most table top games, specific rules trump general rules and the DM's ruling is the most specific of all as the adjudicator. Save minor issues for after the session to keep things flowing smoothly.


## Character Sheet
We require you to have your character sheet always updated and in a format we can check, be it DnDBeyond, GSheet, Dicecloud, scan your paper and upload it via DropBox, etc and the link to it updated in **#pc-sheets**.


## Character Creation
Below are lists for each aspect of character creation. A few key notes not mentioned:

* You start with 900 EXP at level 3.
* We use fixed HP (die average rounded up)
* Point buy for character stat.
* You may opt to start with starting equipment or maximum possible starting gold. Do note that starting with starting gold means you forfeit your background provided equipment.
* You may respec your character freely before you reach level 6, though don't do it too often. Consider your choice or just stick to one thing throughout. Once you play a game after attaining level 6, you finalize your decision. If you wish to make any changes past this point, you should consult with the DM in **#player-dropbox** though it is extremely rare for any major changes to be considered without good reasoning.
* If you're unsure about anything, ask in **#pc-help**!

If you're new to the game, feel free to ask for help in **#player-dropbox**, **#pc-help**, or even **#general-chat**.

### Homebrew Contents
Homebrews are unofficial D&D 5e contents. Sometime, they are extremely well made and fits certain narrative that official contents doesn't cover. If so, we review them to be added. Too much can be bad, however.
Critical Role & UA Contents are considered homebrews.
In addition, if you elect to use a homebrew class/subclass, you are restricted from multiclassing.

These homebrew are always available for character creation as they satisfy many criterias.
* Races
  * Mousefolk
* Class
  * Blood Hunter

#### Rotation
Occasionally, we may allow some homebrew and UA temporarily for character creations within a given time period. These will be announced & listed here.
* None at the moment

#### Out of Rotation
Some people are still alive and kicking with their character from rotation. We preserve them here for to track former homebrew we had allow.

## Homebrew Rulings
The following homebrew rules are used on the server:
* You can drink a potion as a bonus action (administering a potion is still an action.)
* If any ability states that "Your group can't become lost except by magical means.", instead it will read "You gain advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to not become lost."
* Any item attuned to an NPC under your control (such as, but not limited to, familiars, beast companions, simulacrums, conjured creatures, hirelings, lickspittles, etc.) counts against your character’s limit of three attuned items. In order to attune to an item, the NPC attempting to attune to it must have an intelligence score of 6 or higher unless the item says otherwise.
* Additionally, the creature must be capable of wearing/holding the item in particular that they're trying to use. For example, an owl cannot wear a ring or use a magic wand, and a warhorse cannot wield a sword. If you are unsure of the item/creature combination working, send a ping to helpers for clarification in **#player-dropbox**.

## Joining a Game

## Joining the Dungeon Master Team
So you want to be come a Dungeon Master, eh? Well becoming a Dungeon Master on the Fang is more than just being a capable of hosting a game. It involves working cooperatively along side the other Dungeon Masters and keeping a balance outlook on the server. You must take into consideration everything you do for the long term impact on the balance of the server. For example, if you reward one player fire immunity, that throws the balance off for any red dragon encounter the other Dungeon Master wishes to run!

If you're still interested and have read the [Dungeon Master's Guide to the Fang](https://jtrinh3.github.io/Guild-of-the-Fangs-Documents/DMs%20Guide/), then just ask on the **#player-dropbox**.

## Addressing Problems
Not everything might go exactly as you might expect. Perhaps someone did something that makes you uncomfortable. If so, it is suggest you follow these steps to address the problems, only moving onto the next if you feel it wasn't properly look over.
1. Confront the person directly. If you don't feel comfortable talking to them, you can move straight to the next step. Most tabletop problems can be resolve with a direct confrontation. If the person didn't know they cause an issue to begin with, how will they prevent it in the future?
2. Bring it up to the admin. Dungeon Masters are in charge of running the game and world mechanic, where as Admins are in charge of dealing with the leg work of the Discord server and its structure.
3. Use the **#player-dropbox** channel. This should be the last resort for bringing up social issues as we want to keep drama down to a minimum.
