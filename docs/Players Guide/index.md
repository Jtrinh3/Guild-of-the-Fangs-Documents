# Player's Guide

## Statement
The world we journey in is not defined by any texts or foretold tales. The books that lay before us (PHB, Xanathar’s, Monster Manual, etc) can be helpful in understanding this place, but should not be relied on for fact regarding history, trivia, metrics or the details of one’s foe.

You need not worry about metagaming by using these books at the table. All that is found within represents information that one would be likely to find in a nearby library or from a local historian, and if you go to these lengths in our game your character is entitled to all the knowledge they hold. This includes the stat blocks that are listed for the species covered, which represent setting appropriate estimates and anecdotes detailing the appropriate metrics based on personal accounts and encounters.

It is worth noting that as historical estimates and anecdotes often are, the player’s handbook and other such guides are often inaccurate and certainly incomplete. What if the great Basalisk really only has four legs but the last time anyone fought one the lone survivor was a knight who suffered horrible brain damage blurring his memory of the event? Would that be a likely detail to be covered by the castle’s historian? Maybe the last time an ancient green dragon was slain was in the Bronze Age, a time of swords that couldn’t hold an edge the way modern steel can. Perhaps the party a king once commissioned to seek out and slay a beholder for study failed to track one altogether, but made up a story to save their necks. It’s possible that the cat-like form of a displacer beast was just the form that particular creature chose that day, and that was the last time one ever fought anyone who cared to write it down. While the guides we use are simple and effective for our use, they would not be that way in the context our characters would find them. Our guides instead allude to our characters’ clumsy interpretations of the histories they would really find. - [/u/REDDIT_BULL_WORM](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/e59efx/this_is_a_talk_i_like_to_give_at_session_zero_it/)
