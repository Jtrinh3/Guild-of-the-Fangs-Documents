# How the Downtime System Works
###

</div>

## Accruing Downtime
Your active character can begin spending downtime after your character sheet is approved. After approval, you earn 8 Downtime Hours (1 Downtime Day) every real-time day, starting at 12 AM Central Time, that you can use each day. However these are not able to be held onto or collected; use it that day or lose it! Downtime can be used for a number of things while you are not on quests. Your character's skill and tool proficiencies decide what type of activity they may partake in.

## Using Downtime
You can use downtime to perform a number of activities to benefit your player character and other's player characters. In order to perform these downtime activities you need to adhere to the rules related to that activity. Below is a description of each activity rule and how to handle it when spending your downtime. Regardless, you can only 'preload' or dedicate up to 7 days maximum downtime at a time. If you go on a mission or don't have access to the requirements, tools, facilities needed, your progress will be paused.

To log the usage of downtime head over to **#downtime-log** and add a post showing how much Downtime is being used, and how much would remain on the project after usage, if any. In the case of multiple posts being needed for the work, just reply to your last relevant post about the certain activity. 

For example crafting a Superior Healing Potion you would go to **#downtime-log** and put *5 DT > Superior Healing Potion [5/15]* to preload 5 days of crafting the potion or *1 DT > Superior Healing Potion [1/15]*, in both cases each subsequent post about crafting that potion should be a reply to the one prior. All downtime activities that require rolls should have a link to said rolls, taking place in a server channel, in the log post.

## Quests and Downtime
Quests and Missions are your main duties and source of income. So to reflect that, whenever you start a mission you are prohibited from pursuing any downtime activity on the day the mission began.

\columnbreak


## Requirements
Most downtime activities are only available to a character if they are proficient with the relevant tools or skills. If a downtime activity requires anything it will be listed in this section otherwise everyone may perform that downtime activity.

## Resources
Firstly your character must have the necessary time and availability to do downtime activities. Characters are allotted 1 day of Downtime for every real/IRL day that passes. (8 Downtime Hours) Your character must have the hours and actual time to do Downtime Activities. Ex. Being on a Mission may prevent you from crafting something or learning a proficiency. There may also be an additional cost in the form of gold, materials, or additional downtime when performing a specific activity.

## Resolution
Certain activities can grant you additional gold, skills, items, or information. When spending downtime on an activity you must follow the instructions given in this section for each day spent. The basic resolution is only available to you and cannot be given to other characters unless the resolution results in items or gold which follows the normal trade rules.

## Contract Work / Getting Help
You may be able to enlist your fellow adventurers to assist you in certain downtime activities for an agreed upon price. Each activity will have a section labeled as "Help" to disclose who and how many individuals are able to assist you with your activity. Prices of services depend on the two parties involved and can change based on the nature of the work. Either party can contribute downtime days towards the completion of the work only if they meet the requirements listed for that activity.

Helping with a downtime activity requires you to also meet the requirements for the activity. Helping will act as if you are doing a day of the work yourself, so any DC rolls will need to be made by the helper and the original worker. Any failures will add to the gold cost and downtime. However if the team's collective bonus/mods for the roll would beat the DC on a roll, no one of the team is required to roll against the activities DC.

Must speak Common.

### Resources
You must spend 5 downtime days (40 hours) to perform this activity and can only do this activity two times per calendar month (your last day working will determine the month that job falls in).

\columnbreak

Expertise may be gained in any skill, or tool with which you are already proficient regardless of class. However, once you gain expertise through downtime you may not do so again.


\pagebreakNum

<div class='wide'>

## Research
The world contains many secrets waiting to be discovered and understood. Such things are generally only truly able to be understood with field research or with more experience, yet it is never unwise to go to a library and seek past knowledge to aid in your current endeavors, or simply run tests in a safer, and academic environment.

### Requirements
Approval from the DM before the quest is run or approval from a DM involved with the subject you wish to research.

### Resources
A character needs access to a well stocked library to conduct research. Assuming such access is available, conducting research requires one downtime day and at least 50 gp spent on materials, library costs, and other expenses. Any answers or information given are subject to the limitations of the library in question/use.

### Resolution
The character declares the focus of the research: a specific creature, person, place, or thing. After one downtime day, the character makes an Intelligence (Investigation). Additionally the character gains a +1 bonus per 100 gp spent beyond the initial 50 gp, to a maximum of +6, this cost represents hiring additional assistants to aid in your research.

Once rolled you may ask of number of questions about the subject you researched according to the table below. The DM may allow tangential questions if they pop up (for instance if your research reveals a location after the first question you may ask your second question about the location, etc.) but may curate the questions how they wish.

Check Total |	Outcome |
----------- | ----------- |
1-5 | No Effect
6-10 | DM will only tell you something interesting. It's on you to make it useful
11-20 | DM will tell you something interesting and useful about the subject relevant to your situation
21-25 | You may ask one follow up question
26-30 | You may ask two follow up questions
31-35 | You may ask three follow up questions
36+ | You may ask the DM "what is the question I should be asking?" The DM will answer Honestly

The DM of the quest has final say on what this information is revealed through this manner. For a monster or an NPC, they can reveal elements of statistics or personality. For a location, they can reveal secrets about it, such as a hidden entrance, the answer to a riddle, or the nature of a creature that guards the place. However this is all up to the DM to decide and what information can be obtained through this manner.

</div>

\pagebreakNum



## Spell Copying
Aspiring Wizards and Ritual Casters tend to commit their time to the transcribing and practice of new spells to their spell books. When spending downtime to do this you put in the time to both translate and record the spell as well as practice it a few times for when you need to use it.

When you find a Wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your Spellbook if it is of a Spell Level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.

Copying that spell into your Spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the Wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the Sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your Spellbook using your own notation.

### Requirements
You need the Wizard Spellcasting feature, the Ritual Caster feat, or the Book of Ancient Secrets Warlock invocation. The spells you copy must follow the requirements of that feature.

You also need a spell book or scroll containing the spell(s) you wish to copy.
### Resources
For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents Material Components you expend as you experiment with the spell to Master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other Spells.

Spell Level |	Downtime | Cost |
----------- | ----------- | -----------
1st | 2 Hours | 50 gp
2nd | 4 Hours | 100 gp
3rd | 6 Hours | 150 gp
4th | 1 Day | 200 gp
5th | 1 Day, 2 Hours | 250 gp
6th | 1 Day, 4 Hours | 300 gp
7th | 1 Day, 6 Hours | 350 gp
8th | 2 Days | 400 gp
9th | 2 Days, 2 Hours | 450 gp

The College of Neverwinter also provides Guild Members access to scribe spells based on ones rank.

Rank | Spells Available
---|---
Rank C | Level 1-3 Spells
Rank B | Level 4-5 Spells
Rank A | Level 6 Spells
Rank S | Level 7 Spells


\columnbreak


### Resolution
The spells are copied into your spell book.

### Spell Book Duplication
You can copy a spell from your own Spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your Spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your Spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell.



Spell Level |	Downtime | Cost |
----------- | ----------- | -----------
1st | 1 Hour | 10 gp
2nd | 2 Hours | 20 gp
3rd | 3 Hours | 30 gp
4th | 4 Hours | 40 gp
5th | 5 Hours | 50 gp
6th | 6 Hours | 60 gp
7th | 7 Hours | 70 gp
8th | 1 Day | 80 gp
9th | 1 Day, 1 Hour | 90 gp

If you lose your Spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the Spells that you have prepared into a new Spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your Spellbook requires you to find New Spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.
