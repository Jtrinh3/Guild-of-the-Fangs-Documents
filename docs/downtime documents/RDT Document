# Accruing Downtime
Your currently active character can begin collecting downtime after your character sheet is approved. After it is approved you earn 8 Downtime Hours (1 Downtime Day) for every real-time day that passes since your character was approved. Downtime can be used for a number of things outside of doing quests. Some of these depend on the proficiencies of your character.
