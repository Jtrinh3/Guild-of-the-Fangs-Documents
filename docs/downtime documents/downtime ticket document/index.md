# Downtime Ticket Document

## What is a Downtime Ticket (DTT)?
Downtime Ticket, unlike Free Down Time (FDT), is used for more major benefits that you can’t get with just Free Downtime. You are restricted to spending 8 DTT at most in a single real-time day that is separated from FDT.

## What can I do with DTT?

### Proficiency Training
Adventurers undergo plenty of hardship, and in order to come back each time from their trips, they have a bunch of knowledge and training under their belt! In addition to your class and background proficiencies, those in the guild have the opportunity to learn from one another!
Considering that you can only spend 8 DTT per day, this means that practically all training requires multiple days of dedication.

#### Languages
Unlike real life, learning a language in D&D is much easier! Every character can learn a number of languages equal to 1 + their Intelligence mod (minimum of 1)! In order to do so, you must find another character capable of teaching you your desired language. The only two languages that can’t be taught, however, are Thieves’ Cant and Druidic. You can learn more about specific languages in the Basic Rules available here. The amount of DTT cost to learn a language is 100, but that’s to become fully proficient. At 50, you are capable of reading and understanding it, but you can’t speak nor write it.

#### Skills
Being in the guildhall all day doesn’t mean you don’t have to train! Do you need to sharpen your investigative skill? Perhaps work on your athletic form? Or maybe become more tricksy with your sleight of hand! In any case, there are plenty of training opportunities here in the guild. The amount of downtime needed to train a skill starts at 100. For each modifier used by the skill and for each proficiency bonus you have, you reduce the amount of downtime needed by 5.
For example, a character with 12 dex that is level 1 will have a 2 to their proficiency bonus. With 12 DEX, their dex modifier is +1. This means the total downtime needed to learn is 100-5(1+2)=85. If your ability score or proficiency bonus increases at any point throughout the training, your total is also modified! No refund for excess spent though!

#### Tools
Build a bear

#### Exotic Weapons
Slay fashionably

### Scribing Spells
To copy a spell to a book or create a scroll, one requires proficiency in Arcana.

#### Copying to a Spell Book
For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 DTT and costs 50 gp.
Only wizards and a handful of other features allow one to benefit from a spellbook. This includes Warlocks with the Pact of the Tome feature and those with the Ritual Caster feat.
If you are copying from your own book to make a back-up, you need to spend only 1 DTT and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. You may also copy a spell that you know through some other means to your book as well but this requires the full cost.

#### Creating a Spell Scroll
To create a scroll, you need to be able to cast the spell and if there’s any consumed cost in the casting of the spell, you would also need to supply that as well which is consumed when you create the scroll.

## Working in the City
If you’re ever a few coins off or want to express your character more, the area is filled with opportunity! You may find a job related to your skill, such as helping the dock worker or exercising your herbalism at a local shop. In any case, you can spend 8 DTT in the #downtime-log channel and state what kind of gig you’re looking for. Find a channel in the city and announce your work and what ability check you are making. Once you do so, link the check to the original post that you spent your DTT on (copy message link). You gain an amount of gold equal to the total of your ability check.
Now, you may be thinking, can’t a bard just buff themselves? Indeed, but we must consider that this is a single roll to determine how you do throughout the days. Any abilities that don’t last beyond 8 hours will not benefit from this ability check.

# Special Modifiers

## Having Someone Else Teach
Another player may assist your training by spending their own DTT to teach you! In any case, a player may only spend up to 8 DTT per day.

## The Library
With the amount of effort put into constructing the library, it now counts as a source for teaching players up to half proficiency when it comes to skills, languages, and tools. You still need to find someone else to go from half to full though!
