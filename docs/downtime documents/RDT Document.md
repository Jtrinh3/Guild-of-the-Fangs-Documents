# Accruing Downtime
Your currently active character can begin collecting downtime after your character sheet is approved. After it is approved you earn 8 Downtime Hours (1 Downtime Day) for every real-time day that passes since your character was approved. Downtime can be used for a number of things outside of doing quests. Some of these depend on the proficiencies of your character.
# Using Downtime
You can use downtime to perform a number of activities to benefit your character and others. In order to perform these downtime activities you need to adhere to the rules related to that activity. Below is a description of each activity rule and how to handle it when spending your downtime.
## Requirements
Most downtime activities are only available to a character if they are proficient with the relevant tools or skills. If a downtime activity requires anything it will be listed in this section otherwise everyone may perform that downtime activity.
## Resources
Firstly your character must have the necessary time and availability to do downtime activities. Characters are alloted 1 day of Downtime for every real/IRL day that passes. (8 Downtime Hours) Your character must have the hours and actual time to do Downtime Activities. Ex. Being on a Mission may prevent you from crafting something or learning a proficiency. There may also be an additional cost in the form of gold, materials, or additional downtime when performing a specific activity.
## Resolution
Certain activities can grant you additional gold, skills, items, or information. When spending downtime on an activity you must follow the instructions given in this section for each day spent. The basic resolution is only available to you and cannot be given to other characters unless the resolution results in items or gold which follows the normal trade rules.
## Contract Work / Getting Help
You may be able to enlist your fellow adventurers to assist you in certain downtime activities for an agreed upon price. Each activity will have a section labeled as "Help" to disclose who and how many individuals are able to assist you with your activity. Prices of services depend on the two parties involved and can change based on the nature of the work. Either party can contribute downtime days towards the completion of the work only if they meet the requirements listed for that activity.
